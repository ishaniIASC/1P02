  <p class= "firstpara"> Brock is designed to provide students with an <strong>outstanding education and relevant employment-related experience </strong>, preparing graduates to be leaders in their communities and in their careers.Our rigorous undergraduate, graduate and doctoral programs include experiential learning opportunities and one of Canada’s largest co-op programs. Our cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary programs offer multi-faceted degrees that help students build careers and get jobs.
    Brock provides opportunities for social and academic growth that don’t exist at larger universities, like access to professors. Our emphasis on moderate class sizes in seminar settings makes more students full participants in the learning experience.
    Brock University is a special place that’s worth a visit.  </p>
  <p class= "secondpara"> When students from across our seven faculties gave their ratings to the <em>Globe and Mail Canadian University Report </em>, Brock was one of Canada’s top medium-size institutions in terms of quality of education, quality of teaching and most satisfied students.(Taken from Brock Facebook Page)</p>
