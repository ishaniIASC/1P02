</br>Abstract art has been around for well over 100 years—some might even assert that abstraction started with the infamous abstract idea of an eight-legged bison found in cave paintings thousands of years ago—and has held its own against changing art movements, manifestos and testimonials to its demise through all these years. </br>I believe

I believe the continuing interest in abstract art lies in its ability to inspire our curiosity about the reaches of our imagination and the potential for us to create something completely unique in the world.

</br>A major obstacle to making an abstract artwork is the barrier in your mind that questions whether abstract art is a legitimate art form—legitimate for you at least. This block may be because you still wonder, “Is abstract art really ‘art’ at all?” Possibly you think you have to master realism before you can work abstractly? Or it could be that you worry your friends and family won’t approve? </p>
